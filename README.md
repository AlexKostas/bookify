Repository for the 2023 Assignment for the Online Application Techonoligies class in Department of Informatics (University of Athens).

For this assignment we created an online booking application similar to Airbnb or Booking.com. Our app, called Bookify, provides most of the features one would expect to see in an application of this type including but not limited to user registration and profile, profile pictures, an administrator page, room creation page, a page to view all the room details (description, map, photos), reviews, an availability and booking system and a search page that allows various filters and supports pagination.

The application is developed using the client-server model. The server was created using Spring Boot and offers a RESTful API that can be used by various client applications such as websites or mobile apps. The website, created using React and JavaScript, functions as the client providing a nice and intuitive interface for the average user to interact with the app. In the `documentation.pdf` document we have provided installation and execution instructions as well as a detailed discussion of the design of our codebase, along with the main design dilemmas that led to our current implementation. Please refer to that document for the implementation details and execution instructions of our application.
